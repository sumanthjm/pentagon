ğŸ“œ Timeline of CSS Development
ğŸ”§ Early 1990s â€“ Before CSS
Web pages were styled using HTML itself, with tags like <font>, <center>, and <b>.

This made the code cluttered and difficult to maintain or standardize.

ğŸ”§1994 â€“ The Birth of CSS
HÃ¥kon Wium Lie, working with CERN and later W3C, proposed Cascading Style Sheets.

Goal: Separate content (HTML) from presentation (style).

ğŸ”§1996 â€“ CSS1
CSS Level 1 was released by the W3C.

Supported basic styling: fonts, colors, margins, borders, etc.

Browsers started limited support (e.g., Internet Explorer 3, Netscape Navigator 4).

ğŸ”§1998 â€“ CSS2
Introduced positioning, media types, z-index, and better selectors.

Support remained inconsistent across browsers, causing frustration for developers.

ğŸ”§Early 2000s â€“ Browser Wars & Inconsistencies
Browsers implemented CSS differently.

Developers used hacks and workarounds to make websites look consistent.

ğŸ”§2005â€“2010 â€“ CSS2.1 and Modern Browsers
CSS2.1 was refined and widely adopted.

Browsers like Firefox, Safari, and Chrome emerged with better CSS support.

ğŸ”§2011â€“Today â€“ CSS3 and Beyond
CSS3 introduced modules: Flexbox, Grid, Transitions, Animations, Media Queries, etc.

Massive improvement in design capabilities (responsive design, animations, etc.).

Continuous development via CSS Working Group (part of W3C).

ğŸ”§ Key Milestones
Flexbox: Simplified layout control (2012+).

CSS Grid: Full 2D layout system (2017+).

Variables (custom properties): --main-color: red; (2015+).

Subgrid, container queries, and newer selectors: Currently evolving.
